    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn the essential steps to write and run your first protocol for Opentrons robot and you'll also learn some Python along the way. You can edit and run protocol code in each cell by clicking \"Play\" button on the toolbar, or by clicking `Shift+Enter` inside the cell. If something goes wrong and you don't know what's happening, you can always restart the notebook by clicking \"Kernel->Restart & Clear Output\".\n",

    "## Basic Python\n",
    "The protocols you will be writing using Opentrons API are, essentially written in Python language. While you don't have to be a programmer and don't have to know all the details of this beautiful language, here are some basics that will help you get up and running quickly.\n",

    "Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that has some really useful features for a beginning programmer. The code is quite easy to read when compared to other programming languages, and it has an interactive shells, such as Jupyter, into which you can enter your programs and see them run.[Quote Python for Kids]\n"

    "The word variable in programming describes a place to store information such as numbers, text, lists of numbers and text, and so on. Another way of looking at a variable is that it’s like a label for something. For example, to create a variable named `volume`, we use an equal sign (=) and then tell Python what information the variable should be the label for. Here, we create the variable `volume` and tell Python that it labels the number 100 (note that this doesn’t mean that another variable can’t have the same value):"
